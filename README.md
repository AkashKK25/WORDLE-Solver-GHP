## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akashkk25/wordle-solver.git
   cd wordle-solver
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Start a Wordle Game**: Go to the official Wordle website and make your first guess.

2. **Input Your Guess**: Enter the same word into the Wordle Solver.

3. **Set Letter States**: Click on each letter to cycle through the states:
   - Gray (absent): Letter is not in the word
   - Yellow (present): Letter is in the word but in the wrong position
   - Green (correct): Letter is in the correct position

4. **Get Results**: Click the "Solve" button to see a list of possible words.

5. **Make Your Next Guess**: Choose a word from the suggestions for your next Wordle guess.

6. **Repeat**: Continue the process until you solve the puzzle.

## üß© How It Works

The Wordle Solver uses constraint-based filtering to narrow down possible words:

1. **Green Letters**: Filters for words that have the correct letter in the correct position.
2. **Yellow Letters**: Filters for words that contain these letters in any positions.
3. **Gray Letters**: Filters out words that contain these letters (unless they appear as green or yellow elsewhere).

The application uses two dictionaries:
- A common words dictionary containing frequently used 5-letter words
- A rare words dictionary for less common words
